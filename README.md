actual problem -> statistical solution
via EDA - exploratory data analysis

performance matrix(pm) - MAPE, MAE 
statistical solution is pm
data split - 70-30 , 70% training 30%testing  
first 70 values is for training and rest for testing , model gets 70% while training
smaller datasent- 80-20 split

mae-mean absolute error - difference between actual and predicted vale
mape- mean absolute percentage error - percentage of difference between actual and predicted value
mape=0 for the training dataset it is called overfitting( model is fitting very tightly in the dataset)

variance and bias 

sgq -> scenario gap quest 
scenario - stakeholders roles and responsibility , expectation 
future - some % inc or dec , action , outcome(benefit)

holt winters model - predict next quater 

Python libraries:NUMPY, PANDAS, MATPLOTLIB

SGQ- Scenario Gap Quest   
Scenario - Stakeholders, Roles and Responsibility, Expectation    
Gap-    
Future - some % inc or dec, action, outcome

Every model has seasonality and stationality- the data spit of 30% and 70% is used to determine 

if MAPE is 0%- overfitting(model is fitting very tightly to the data set.)
