actual problem -> statistical solution
via EDA - exploratory data analysis

performance matrix(pm) - MAPE, MAE 
statistical solution is pm
data split - 70-30 , 70% training 30%testing  
first 70 values is for training and rest for testing , model gets 70% while training
smaller datasent- 80-20 split

mae-mean absolute error - difference between actual and predicted vale
mape- mean absolute percentage error - percentage of difference between actual and predicted value
mape=0 for the training dataset it is called overfitting( model is fitting very tightly in the dataset)
